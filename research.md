  <p>They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Now let's put some happy little
    clouds in here. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all.</p>

  <p>Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. We have a fantastic little sky!</p>

  <p>All kinds of happy little splashes. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. We need dark
    in order to show light. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself.</p>

  <p>Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it.</p>

  <p>If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. In this world, everything can be happy. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be.
    And just raise cain.</p>

  <p>There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy.</p>

  <p>Let your imagination be your guide. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Every highlight needs it's own personal
    shadow. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Working it up and down, back and forth.</p>

  <p>Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as
    I want it. Let's build an almighty mountain. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator.</p>

  <p>We have a fantastic little sky! Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything
    that happens.</p>

  <p>You have to make those little noises or it won't work. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about.</p>

  <p>Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can
    do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.</p>

  <p>If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. And I will hypnotize
    that just a little bit. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner.</p>

  <p>There it is. Don't fiddle with it all day. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around.</p>

  <p>All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. But we're not there
    yet, so we don't need to worry about it. All you have to learn here is how to have fun.</p>

### Research 

**Science & health communication**
The dissemination of scientific knowledge to the public has important implications for policy-making in our society. This is because the public’s increased awareness and knowledge of science and scientific findings can contribute to creating healthy discourses about relevant topics (i.e., climate change, nanotechnology, and vaccine safety). However, over the past decade, concerns about being scientifically under- or misinformed have been growing, such as the issue of fake news and social media promoting the spread of misinformation. In recent years, attention has been given to communication researchers, who can bridge the gap between the people involved in scientific research and lay audiences. It is crucial that we develop a strategy to ease the intensity, complexity, and intricacy of science and scientific findings in order for the general public to comprehend.

To date, it is believed that if members of the general public are provided with knowledge of scientific matters, their science literacy will increase, and they will adopt views consistent with experts. However, recent science communication works have pointed out that the same communication messages cannot be used for everybody because different people around the world interpret and process new information based on their existing beliefs. Therefore, science communication messages need to consider the relevant beliefs that viewers already hold and use effective message features. I hope my research works will add to the body of research on communication strategies and thus enhance the relevance of scientific information for a diverse audience.

* Visual messages 
* Experimental Designs 

**Eye-tracking**
Eye tracking method offers researchers an opportunity to collect an objective assessment of visual behavior, such as attention, exposure time, and cognitve processing.
