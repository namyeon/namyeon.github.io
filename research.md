### Research 

**Science & health communication**
The dissemination of scientific knowledge to the public has important implications for policy-making in our society. This is because the publicâ€™s increased awareness and knowledge of science and scientific findings can contribute to creating healthy discourses about relevant topics (i.e., climate change, nanotechnology, and vaccine safety). However, over the past decade, concerns about being scientifically under- or misinformed have been growing, such as the issue of fake news and social media promoting the spread of misinformation. In recent years, attention has been given to communication researchers, who can bridge the gap between the people involved in scientific research and lay audiences. It is crucial that we develop a strategy to ease the intensity, complexity, and intricacy of science and scientific findings in order for the general public to comprehend.

To date, it is believed that if members of the general public are provided with knowledge of scientific matters, their science literacy will increase, and they will adopt views consistent with experts. However, recent science communication works have pointed out that the same communication messages cannot be used for everybody because different people around the world interpret and process new information based on their existing beliefs. Therefore, science communication messages need to consider the relevant beliefs that viewers already hold and use effective message features. I hope my research works will add to the body of research on communication strategies and thus enhance the relevance of scientific information for a diverse audience.
