## Teaching

The Missouri School of Journalism is known for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_School_of_Journalism" target="_blank">the Missouri Method.</a> It combines a liberal arts education with hands-on training in professional media. Real-world media experience is part of the curriculum for every journalism student whether s/he studies strategic communication, print, broadcast, convergence, or magazine journalism. Students receive class credits and gain work experience by working at various professional media organizations depending on their program sequence. As a student who appreciated this curriculum, I teach students to apply their theoretical foundations (e.g., quantitative survey designs) to relevant, practical media skill (e.g., data visualization based on their Qualtrics survey results) to help them get more prepared in the field of <a href="https://journalism.missouri.edu/degrees-programs/undergraduate-degrees/strategic-communication/" target="_blank">strategic communication.</a>
