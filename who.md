### About Me

My name is Namyeon (pronounced as "_nahm-yuhn_"). Originally from Seoul, South Korea, I came to the United States in 2006 through a high school exchange student program. I completed my undergraduate study and masterâ€™s work at the University of Missouri School of Journalism (MA â€˜16, BJ â€˜14) and will complete my PhD in Spring 2020. 

The Missouri School of Journalism is known for the Missouri Method. It combines a liberal arts education with hands-on training in professional media. Real-world media experience is part of the curriculum for every journalism student whether s/he studies strategic communication, print, broadcast, convergence, or magazine jouralism. Students receive class credits and gain work experience by working at various professional media organizations depending on their program sequence. As a student who appreciated this curriculum, I teach students to apply their theoretical foundations (e.g., quantitative survey designs) to relevant, practical media skill (e.g., data visualization based on their Qualtrics survey results) to help them get more prepared in the field of strategic communication.

I previously worked for University of Missouri College of Education as a graphic designer. I also worked for a nonprofit organization, Slow Food Korea, as a public relations specialist and completed in several international internships during the course of my education. I have interned for McCann Worldgroup in Japan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Korea in Vietnam. You can see the map below to see places I've lived or stayed. Who knows where my next destination will be, but as long as there are mossy woods, big rivers, and a Korean grocery store, I know I will be more than grateful ðŸ¤—
