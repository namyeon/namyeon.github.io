### About Me

My name is Namyeon. I was born in Seoul, South Korea and lived their till I was 16 years old. Then I applied for an exchange student program through a newspaper company (_The Hankyoreh_), and I was assigned to a host family in a small town in Missouri, called Concordia. After spending a year in Concorida, I wanted to stay longer in the States. This time, I moved to a prep school in Dover-Foxcroft, Maine. I attended Foxcroft Academy for two years. After Foxcroft, I enrolled at the Colby College, in Waterville, Maine, and attended there for three semesters before I transferred to University of Missouri (MU). I completed my undergraduate study and master’s work at MU (MA ‘16, BJ ‘14) and will complete my PhD in Spring 2020. 

In addition, I previously worked for a nonprofit organization, Slow Food Korea, as a public relations specialist and completed in several international internships during the course of my education. I have interned for McCann Worldgroup in Japan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Korea in Vietnam. You can see the map below to see places I've lived or stayed. I don't know where my next destination will be, but as long as there are mossy woods, big rivers, and a Korean grocery store, I will more than grateful.
