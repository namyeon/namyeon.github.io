### About Me

My name is Namyeon (pronounces as "_nahm-yuhn_"). Originally from Seoul, South Korea, I came to the United States in 2006 through a high school exchange student program. I was assigned to a host family in a small town in Missouri, called Concordia. After spending a year there, I moved to Dover-Foxcroft, Maine and attended Foxcroft Academy for two years. After Foxcroft, I attended Colby College, in Waterville, Maine, for three semesters before I transferred to the Missouri School of Journalism at the University of Missouri (MU). I completed my undergraduate study and master’s work at MU (MA ‘16, BJ ‘14) and will complete my PhD in Spring 2020. 

The Missouri School of Journalism is known for the Missouri Method. It combines a liberal arts education with hands-on training in professional media. Real-world media experience is part of the curriculum for every journalism student whether s/he studies strategic communication, print, broadcast, photojournalism, convergence, or magazine. Students receive class credits and gain work experience by working at various professional media organizations depending on their program sequence. As an instructor who was trained in this curriculum, I work with students to apply students' theoretical foundations (e.g., quantitative survey designs) to their relevant, practical media skill (e.g., data visualization based on their Qualtrics survey results). 

In addition, I previously worked for University of Missouri College of Education as a graphic designer. I also worked for a nonprofit organization, Slow Food Korea, as a public relations specialist and completed in several international internships during the course of my education. I have interned for McCann Worldgroup in Japan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Korea in Vietnam. You can see the map below to see places I've lived or stayed. 

Who knows where my next destination will be, but as long as there are mossy woods, big rivers, and a Korean grocery store, I know I will be more than grateful 🤗
