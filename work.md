## Graphic Designs 

I have worked as a graphic designer at the University of Missouri College of Education. My duties included developing communication and promotion strategies, including e-screens, print, social media, and videography. I also designed marketing materials for events, newsletters, and materials to communicate with undergraduate and graduate students from the College of Ed. These are some of the examples of my work :)
