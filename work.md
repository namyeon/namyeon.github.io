## Graphic Designs 

I have worked as a graphic designer at the University of Missouri College of Education. My duties included developing communication and promotion strategies, including e-screens, print, social media, and videography to communicate with undergraduate and graduate students from the College of Ed. I also worked in an integrated marketing campaign for our client, Boone Hospital Foundation. I also work on design projects for my church from time to time. 

These are some of the examples of my design work :)
