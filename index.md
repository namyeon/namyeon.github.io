### In the past,

I worked as a graphic designer for University of Missouri College of Education. Here's some of my work. Working as a graphic designer helped me to build off my research on theory-driven message strategies. For instance, my previous research on clinical trial advertisements examined how visual representation of race and communication source would affect clinical trial participation [IP. 2]. I also previously worked for a nonprofit organization, Slow Food Korea, as a public relations specialist and completed in several international internships: I have interned for McCann Worldgroup in Japan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Korea in Vietnam. 

I taught the Strategic Communication Research Methods class as an instructor of record in Fall 2018.  I also served as the teaching assistant for two undergraduate courses, Strategic Communication Research Methods and Strategic Writing and Design.
