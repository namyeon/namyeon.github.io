### Message Development & Evaluation <br> 
The dissemination of scientific knowledge to the public has important implications for policymaking in our society because the public’s increased awareness and knowledge of health and scientific findings can contribute to creating healthy discourse about relevant topics. Over the past decade, concerns about being scientifically underinformed or misinformed, such as the issues of fake news and social media promotion of misinformation, have been growing. In pursuit of how scientific knowledge can be better communicated to news audiences, my research has been focused on how the implementation of various visual images (e.g., information visualizations, photographs) would influence audience responses to news stories about intricate science and health matters.

### Communicating on Digital Media Platform <br>
Social media outlets can disseminate critical information to a wider community efficiently. Scientists and health communicators use social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram to the public that enhance the understanding of science matters and engages more people. I have investigated social media’s role in health and science communication on Twitter (for text-based content) and Instagram (for image-based content) to analyze existing social media content and suggested avenues for further research to promote evidence-based communication techniques tailored to current media platforms.
