With the aim to test the inoculation theory of resistance to persuasion in the context of college students’ health, **this study investigates audiences’ cognitive, affective, and behavioral responses to the health messages,** when information is inoculated against persuasive attacks – i.e., present potential risk and threat associated with the health behavior and counterargument to the risk, and then refute the counterargument, or not. In addition, information source of the messages will be presented either by a peer or an expert, and the messages will include photographs or illustrated graphs that represents the perceived threat. In particular, within the study, visual attention to the messages is operationalized as eye-tracking measures along with self-reports.
<br><br>
The **inoculation theory** postulates that when both sides of an issue are presented, a greater resistance to persuasion is conferred against counter-attitudinal messages. Two-sided messages sort into two types: non-refutational messages (i.e., acknowledging the opposing arguments but not attempting to refute them) and refutational messages (i.e., acknowledging and refuting the opposing arguments). By employing the refutational message as one of the message features, this study tests whether participants will be more resistant for future persuasive efforts, when they are exposed to small doses of opposing viewpoints. <br><br>
Secondly, a possible source of representations in college student–targeted health news is the **contrast between a peer (i.e., high perceived similarity to students) and a scientist (i.e., high perceived expertise on news content).** Peer messages will be delivered from the college students’ perspective and use a conversational tone, whereas expert messages use didactic tones and include statistical information. Findings from exemplification studies suggest that the inclusion of like-aged peers conveys trust effectively, whereas the inclusion of medical experts is necessary for motivating compliance (Zillmann, 2002). Few studies related to inoculation theory have addressed this factor in their message designs (Compton & Pfau, 2005). 
<br><br>
Lastly, previous research on exemplification has found that photographic exemplars are easily remembered (Reinhardt, Weber, & Rossmann), lead to more intense affective responses (Zillman, Gibson & Sargent, 1999), and appear to be more trustworthy and authentic (Brosius, 1995). By contrast, base-rate information (e.g., statistics) appears to have less impact on changes in one’s attitude and beliefs (Zillman, Gibson & Sargent, 1999) and is less attention-grabbing (Uribe, Manzur, & Hidalgo, 2013). Thus, this research also examines whether **presenting visual representations of threats in photographic or illustrative** (e.g., a photo of an injured student from an electric scooter vs. a bar graph that shows injury rates) formats can affect responses to the message, and whether or not any significant interactions between the message source and visual representation exist. 
<br><br>
Therefore, the laboratory-based experiment will have a **2 (message type: inoculation vs. supportive) x 2 (message source: peer vs. expert) x 2 (visual exemplar: photographs vs. illustrated graphs) x 4 (message topic: stimulant drugs vs. e-cigarettes vs. electric scooters vs. binge drinking) mixed factorial design** in which message type is only a between-subjects factor and the message source, visual exemplar, and message topic are within-subjects factors. For the message repetition, four topics were chosen based on their degree of relevance, their familiarity, and the attitude surrounding their use among college students. In addition, this study examines whether one’s pre-existing attitude, issue involvement, and trust in scientific authorities would moderate the message effect.
