## Research Statement 
My dissertation work looks at how to develop strategies that science communication scholars and practitioners can use to increase public awareness of and engagement in scientific information. Two specific questions are addressed: 

1. How can we increase public engagement with science and what potential message elements can be employed to ease the cognitive burden of the public? and 
2. What psychological factors of individuals should be considered to increase scientific engagement? 

I address the above questions by using eye-tracking measures and self-reports in a media-effect laboratory experiment setting. 
This dissertation examines the effect of inoculation messages in the context of scientific news delivered via social media. Specifically, the project asks whether the presence of inoculation messages enhances viewers’ cognitive and affective responses to, and comprehension of, scientific news. Based on the inoculation theory (McGuire, 1964), which posits that pre-exposure to a weakened version of a message works in the same way as a vaccination, my research explores whether pre- exposure to a message that debunks the misinformation (that is, inoculation treatment) can prevent the recipient from misunderstanding complex and controversial scientific findings. 


The dissertation also examines whether the presence of a different number of popularity cues—such as the number of likes (bandwagon effect; Sundar, 2008) on social media—can moderate the effects of inoculation messages. Further, the dissertation adopts motivated reasoning (Kunda, 1990) and includes the level of individual differences—that is, how people with different social, political, and/or religious values process new information or knowledge—as another variable to modulate the effect of message elements.
